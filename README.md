# Linear Interpolation Fractional Charge Density Functional Theory (LI-FC-DFT)
This is a program that supports single-point energy, geometry optimization, and vibrational frequency calculations of systems with fractional number of electrons by imposing the Perdew-Parr-Levy-Balduz condition.


The program is written on geomeTRIC code. Currently, it supports PySCF and Jaguar.
